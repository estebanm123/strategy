## Code style
- camelCase for all variables and method names that aren't Godot APIs
- PascalCase for class names and constants
- break up lines that are over 100 characters
- use type annotations when declaring variables
- no code comments unless the code is very unintuitive
## General
- Godot version is 4.5 - some Godot 3 APIs are not available
- Do not create uid files, Godot will create them automatically.
